# Jesus and the Law of Israel

## Session 10: Alien Animals in Israel’s House

---
layout: statement

# As sojourning aliens among Israel, gentile believers should...
## **abstain from food sacrificed to idols,**
## **observe the ancient prohibition against eating blood,**
## **and abstain from sexual immorality**
# ... to live in harmony with Jewish believers.

<!--
* Importantly, the food-related regulations begin to change as early as Paul's churches.
* The goal here is to facilitate healthy relationships between Jewish and gentile believers.
    * This "Christian kashrut" is not about personal piety, but about communal harmony.
* Paul will expand much more on the issues of idolatry and sexual sin in his epistles.
* In my view, these regulations are not permanent statutes that modern Christians ought to observe.
    * By and large, disputes over *kashrut* are basically absent from early Christianity after this point.
        * There are no NT texts that take up the question of whether gentile Christians should observe *kashrut*; it's arguably not really an issue in Acts 15 either, since the dispute is primarily over circumcision/Judaization generally, not *kashrut* specifically.
        * All other food-related disputes in NT texts are in reference to food sacrificed to idols, which is categorically different from *kashrut*.

# Modern gentile Christians are not obligated to observe *kashrut* simply because they are not natural-born Israelites.

<!--
* In other words, why don't I follow the law of Israel? Because it's not my law.
* Gentiles join the people of God *as gentiles*, i.e., through faith in Jesus and the gift of the Holy Spirit.
* The apostles clearly ask gentile believers to adhere to certain Torah laws that apply *to gentiles* for the sake of communal harmony and moral purity.
* This does not mean that biblical law can't have a Third Use function for gentile Christians.
    * But in terms of *kashrut* specifically, gentile Christians are not obligated to observe regulations that were intended to distinguish *ethnic Israel* from the nations.
    * *Kashrut* is just as much of a boundary marker as circumcision.

# A few statements:
## Jesus keeps and does not abolish biblical law.
## The apostles keep biblical law and teach others to do the same.
## The Holy Spirit purifies Jewish and gentile believers alike.
## Biblical law obligates different people differently.

# Deuteronomy 28:58--68 (NRSV)
If you do not diligently observe all the words of this law that are written in this book, fearing this glorious and awesome name, the <sc>Lord</sc> your God, then the <sc>Lord</sc> will overwhelm both you and your offspring with severe and lasting afflictions and grievous and lasting maladies. He will bring back upon you all the diseases of Egypt, of which you were in dread, and they shall cling to you. Every other malady and affliction, even though not recorded in the book of this law, the <sc>Lord</sc> will inflict on you until you are destroyed. Although once you were _as numerous as the stars in heaven_, you shall be left few in number, because you did not obey the <sc>Lord</sc> your God. And just as the <sc>Lord</sc> took delight in making you prosperous and numerous, so the <sc>Lord</sc> will take delight in bringing you to ruin and destruction; you shall be plucked off the land that you are entering to possess. The <sc>Lord</sc> will _scatter you among all peoples_, from one end of the earth to the other; and there you shall _serve other gods_, of wood and stone, which neither you nor your ancestors have known\.\.\.\. The <sc>Lord</sc> will bring you back in ships to Egypt, by a route that I promised you would never see again; and there you shall offer yourselves for sale to your enemies as male and female slaves, but there will be no buyer.

<!--
* The entire story of Israel's exile is summarized here as a revocation of the exodus.
* This is predicated on obedience to "all the words of this law," which is the entirety of the law of Moses.

# Ezekiel 36:16--21
The word of the LORD came to me: Mortal, when the house of Israel lived on their own soil, they defiled it with their ways and their deeds; their conduct in my sight was like the uncleanness of a woman in her menstrual period.
So I poured out my wrath upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land, and for the idols with which they had defiled it.
I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries; in accordance with their conduct and their deeds I judged them.
But when they came to the nations, wherever they came, they profaned my holy name, in that it was said of them, “These are the people of the <sc>Lord</sc>, and yet they had to go out of his land.”
But I had concern for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations to which they came.

# Ezekiel 36:23--36
I will sanctify my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, and which you have profaned among them; and the nations shall know that I am the <sc>Lord</sc>, says the Lord <sc>God</sc>, when through you I display my holiness before their eyes.
I will take you from the nations, and gather you from all the countries, and bring you into your own land.
I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols I will cleanse you.
A new heart I will give you, and a new spirit I will put within you; and I will remove from your body the heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.
I will put my spirit within you, and make you follow my statutes and be careful to observe my ordinances.
Then you shall live in the land that I gave to your ancestors; and you shall be my people, and I will be your God.
Thus says the Lord <sc>God</sc>: On the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the towns to be inhabited, and the waste places shall be rebuilt\.\.\.
Then the nations that are left all around you shall know that I, the <sc>Lord</sc>, have rebuilt the ruined places, and replanted that which was desolate; I, the <sc>Lord</sc>, have spoken, and I will do it.

# Ezekiel 37:1--10
The hand of the <sc>Lord</sc> came upon me, and he brought me out by the spirit of the <sc>Lord</sc> and set me down in the middle of a valley; it was full of bones.
He led me all around them; there were very many lying in the valley, and they were very dry.
He said to me, “Mortal, can these bones live?” I answered, “O Lord <sc>Lord</sc>, you know.”
Then he said to me, “Prophesy to these bones, and say to them: O dry bones, hear the word of the <sc>Lord</sc>.
Thus says the Lord <sc>God</sc> to these bones: I will cause breath to enter you, and you shall live.
I will lay sinews on you, and will cause flesh to come upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live; and you shall know that I am the <sc>Lord</sc>.”
So I prophesied as I had been commanded; and as I prophesied, suddenly there was a noise, a rattling, and the bones came together, bone to its bone.
I looked, and there were sinews on them, and flesh had come upon them, and skin had covered them; but there was no breath in them.
Then he said to me, “Prophesy to the breath, prophesy, mortal, and say to the breath: Thus says the Lord <sc>God</sc>: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.”
I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood on their feet, a vast multitude.

# Ezekiel 37:11--14
Then he said to me, “Mortal, these bones are the whole house of Israel.
They say, ‘Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are cut off completely.’
Therefore prophesy, and say to them, Thus says the Lord <sc>God</sc>: I am going to open your graves, and bring you up from your graves, O my people; and I will bring you back to the land of Israel.
And you shall know that I am the <sc>Lord</sc>, when I open your graves, and bring you up from your graves, O my people.
I will put my spirit within you, and you shall live, and I will place you on your own soil; then you shall know that I, the <sc>Lord</sc>, have spoken and will act,” says the <sc>Lord</sc>.

# Jeremiah 31:31--34
The days are surely coming, says the <sc>Lord</sc>, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah.
It will not be like the covenant that I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt—a covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, says the <sc>Lord</sc>.
But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the <sc>Lord</sc>: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
No longer shall they teach one another, or say to each other, “Know the <sc>Lord</sc>,” for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, says the <sc>Lord</sc>; for I will forgive their iniquity, and remember their sin no more.

<!--
* The difference in this new covenant is the location of the law.
